# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Overview of Project


The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

In this project, We are reviewing the Electronics category to analyze datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. PySpark was used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
